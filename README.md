# Netflix-UI-Clone-
This project is a user interface (UI) clone of the popular streaming service Netflix, created using HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the visual layout and design of the Netflix homepage.

Due to HTML and CSS limitations, this clone won't include features like user accounts, movie playback, or search functionalities.
